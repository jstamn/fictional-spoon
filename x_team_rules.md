# X-Team 17 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

People can choose what parts they want to work on (first come first serve), then we can randomly assign tasks to left over people who don't have a preference. If two people want the same task they can flip a coin or work it out some other way.

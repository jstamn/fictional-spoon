# X-Team 17 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

People can choose what parts they want to work on (first come first serve), then we can randomly assign tasks to left over people who don't have a preference. If two people want the same task they can flip a coin or work it out some other way.

## How we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

The team leader will have a document of the tasks that need to be completed by certain dates. If the tasks are not completed the team leader can send the person a email asking if they need help. The date set for tasks to be completed by will be set a while before teh deadline to allow for unexpected issues that arrise.

## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

Send an email to the group or team leader saying that you are having difficulties with a specific problem or trouble getting started ect. Then other group members can try to help as much as they can without doing the entire thing for the person.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

If a task is not completed by a certain date, the team leader will email the person asking if they need help. Other group members can step in and help but not doing the whole assignment for the person. If they have some emergency and cannot complete the task, other group members can work on the task.

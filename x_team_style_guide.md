# X-Team NN Style Guide

We are looking to create discriptive names for all aspects of our programs, following conventions listed below. This style guide is built off of the CS300 Style Guide
## Naming conventions

All names and variables describe what they are used for following convention listed below

### Examples
* interfaces
 * 
* classes
* exception types
* fields
* methods
* parameters
* local variables
* instance constants
* class constants

## Commenting style for public and private members of a class or interface:

All comments follow the following conventions for each example listed below.

### Examples

* classes - Include JavaDoc comments for each class briefly explaining what the purpose of the class is.
* fields - Add inline comments for fields giving a brief explanation of the field and its purpose.
* constructors - Include JavaDoc comments for constructors to explain what is being constructed and its purpose.
* methods - Include JavaDoc comments for each method as well as block tags for things such as parameters, returns, throws, etc.
* coding style (brackets, horizontal, and vertical spacing) for:
  * if statements 
  * switch statement
  * while loops
  * for loops
  * enhanced for loops
  
  Use brackets and vertical spacing for all of these, even if it is not needed. Brackets should be on the same line as the if     statements/method names/for loops etc. and have a space separating them from the character to their left. For example:
      
      if (x == 0) {
         x == 1; 
      }
